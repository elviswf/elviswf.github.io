> A trustworthy AI agent is an explainable and iterative inference process.

In the era of generative AI, software applications are gradually evolving from tools that facilitate processes, workflows, and tasks to intelligent systems that can work on behalf of end users, especially in the enterprise market, where software applications will evolve from merely supporting the execution of business processes to intelligent applications that perform or partially do work on behalf of human employees.

According to Gartner, a world-renowned consulting firm, "intelligent applications" **learn from data, adapt to user behavior, and make autonomous decisions to optimize performance and outcomes.**

The transformation of software applications to intelligent applications is not only the progress and development of technology, but also means that the functions and values of software applications will undergo profound changes, bringing new opportunities and challenges to the management and operation of enterprises, and will also trigger a new wave of business and technology transformation. In the era of intelligent applications, SaaS, which was born 25 years ago, will also gain a new connotation, changing from "Software as a Service" to "Service as a Software".

In the enterprise market, the role and capabilities of the digital employee, the most typical intelligent application, have evolved and evolved – from Copilot (similar to a co-pilot or support role), to bridging the gap between business experts and ordinary employees in the enterprise, to being able to run the entire business process autonomously.

As large models become smarter and smarter, AI agents will gradually accumulate data that interacts with the digital, physical, and intelligent worlds, and move towards the stage of autonomy. In this process, the data of expert knowledge and the process of value judgment/deduction guided by expert knowledge are the most scarce, so it is also a key factor restricting the development of the industry.

The ability of large models will become stronger, and the level of human-computer collaboration and knowledge digitization will also evolve - there are already open source models equivalent to GPT-4 in China (QWEN2.5 72B), so when designing AI Agent, it can be assumed that the Agent has cheap, general natural language understanding and expression capabilities, as well as reasoning capabilities equivalent to high Chinese students, and we found that this level of Agent can use data, The knowledge in the documents is used to assist ordinary employees in completing complex business tasks.

### How Does a Trusted AI Agent Help Achieve Intelligent Applications? 

According to a just-released annual report on generative AI by Sequoia, "the release of o1 represents a significant advance in general inference capabilities through 'computation-on-reasoning', which is the 'AlphaGo moment' for generative AI and an important turning point in the scaling law of large models." The more we calculate the inference time of the model, the better its inference will be. This will also further drive the availability of the application layer. ”

In my opinion, the process of AI Agent completing complex tasks is the implementation process of intelligent applications, and it can also be abstracted as the process of intelligent matching between demand and supply. A trusted AI agent is an explainable and iterative inference process.

On the demand side, there are data such as customer portraits, such as industry, financial model, factory size, and so on. Each specific need, whether it is the financial need for this period of time, or the requirements of the factory layout, or a specific voyage, has many dimensions of conditions or restrictions.

On the supply side, the standard itself has many attributes, such as price, time, power, and many case references, such as industry best practices or last purchased content, etc.

Therefore, in the face of the problem of intelligent matching between demand and supply, the core test is the planning capability of the AI agent, which is composed of several modules:

The first is the understanding of user portraits/preferences (or how to ascend the dimension into a vector in a high-dimensional space), the second is the recommendation of combinatorial solutions (or through reasoning, searching for a suitable solution and summarizing the selling points of the solution), and the third is the value function that can evaluate the matching of needs and solutions. Of course, it is acceptable that there is no value function during a cold start, because we can understand the user's preferences for different solutions through multiple rounds of dialogue with the user.

Taking the scenario of booking air tickets as an example, each user has a different portrait when booking tickets, such as whether they are price-sensitive and which passport they hold; There is also a change of scene, is it business or vacation? As well as different preferences such as airline/aircraft type, seats, meals, and of course, most importantly, the cost of money and time.

Customer portraits and customer ticket history can help to have an evaluation function of a priori probability distribution of ticket combinations, but in the absence of a large model, only some pre-set options such as price priority or time priority can be used to obtain user-specific preferences, and cannot meet more complex needs, such as overnight prices must be below 5,000 yuan, or want to stay at Singapore airport for more than 3 hours.

Abstracting these scenarios, we can find that the vast majority of user cases are "how to meet user needs", that is, the matching of demand and supply.

As the agent planning capability becomes stronger and stronger, embedding such intelligence in existing applications can be upgraded to "intelligent applications" mentioned by Gartner.

According to Gartner, an intelligent application should have five characteristics: data connectivity, composable architecture, embedded intelligence, self-orchestration, and adaptive experience. We believe that the five characteristics of intelligent applications can be implemented in three stages:

The first stage is to be able to connect more data and assembleable architecture, which can be achieved by the current agent;

The second stage is automatic orchestration and embedded intelligence, which will be realized with the strengthening and improvement of agent planning capabilities.

The final stage is when the app is able to adapt itself to changes in user needs.
